# Pipeline Inspection Robot Simulation

This demo shows an in-pipe robot equipped with:
- Camera and sensors to detect corrosion or biofilm spots.
- An antibacterial cold-spray system that coats infected areas inside oil pipelines.

Run using:
```bash
python robot_pipeline_sim.py
```

A GIF animation will be saved as `pipeline_robot_coldspray_sim.gif`.
